### Tips
- Use a shovel to collect the deposits
- Don't spam sneak
- Keep an eye on the recipe book
- The fermentation process requires blocks to be in a dark environment, above a block that is adjacent to water
- There is a faster fermentation process that involves dangling blocks from a soggy rope in a dim place
- Once you obtain fermented matter, try using the centrifuge
- Use a calibrator to link wireless torches together. They require power to light up
- The maymay block is cool, but be careful - if the server is weak then you can cause server crashes with this block
- One can modify the new tnt blocks via crafting. Try adding *black powder*, *string*, *pickaxes*, *feathers*, *arrows*, and *coal*
  - It's also possible to combine these blocks together - even different types.
